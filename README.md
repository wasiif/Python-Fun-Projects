### Dice Rolling Simulator
**Description**: A simple program that simulates rolling two dice. Each roll generates random numbers between 1 and 6 for each die, mimicking a real dice roll experience.  
**Purpose**: This program demonstrates random number generation and basic control flow in Python.

---

### QR Code Generator
**Description**: This program generates a QR code from user-inputted data and saves it as an image file.  
**Purpose**: It introduces the `qrcode` library and demonstrates how to create and save images in Python.

---

### Number Guessing Game
**Description**: A fun guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. Hints are provided to guide the player closer to the target number.  
**Purpose**: This project covers loops, conditionals, user input handling, and error handling with try-except blocks.

---

### Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
**Description**: A classic game where the user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors and plays against the computer’s random choice. The program displays results (win, lose, or tie) with emojis for a fun interaction.  
**Purpose**: This project is a great exercise for practicing conditional statements, user input, and randomness in Python.

---

### Multiplication Table Generator
**Description**: This program generates a multiplication table for a user-specified number, displaying it in a clear and organized format.  
**Purpose**: An exercise in using loops and formatted strings to create a clean, readable output.

---

### Basic Calculator
**Description**: A calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—based on the operator chosen by the user. It also checks for division by zero to avoid errors.  
**Purpose**: This program reinforces conditional statements and user input handling, while introducing simple error-checking logic.
